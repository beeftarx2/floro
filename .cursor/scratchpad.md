# Floro Project - Google OAuth Implementation

## Background and Motivation

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Status**: Google OAuth Authentication Fully Working - Milestone 1.1 Complete! ðŸŽ‰

**Next Action**: The Google OAuth login flow has been verified and is working correctly. The application is ready for the next milestone (Milestone 1.2: User Profile Database).

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**Current Request**: All errors have been completely resolved! The application has been fully recovered:

- âœ… **Fixed runtime authentication errors** with improved client lifecycle management
- âœ… **Fixed webpack module corruption** by clearing build cache
- âœ… **Fixed OAuth callback route errors** with better server client creation
- âœ… **Fixed client-side "Auth session missing!" errors** with proper error handling
- âœ… **Fixed severe build corruption** with missing "_document.js" and "_app" modules
- âœ… **Enhanced error handling** throughout the authentication flow
- âœ… **Improved debugging** with comprehensive logging
- âœ… **Robust fallback mechanisms** for edge cases

**What's working now**: The application:
- Loads successfully without any server errors
- Shows the login page properly with Google OAuth button
- Handles OAuth callback without any module errors
- Manages authentication state correctly without console errors
- Handles missing auth sessions gracefully (not as errors)
- Has been completely rebuilt from scratch to eliminate corruption
- Provides clear error messages and debugging information
- **COMPLETED**: Google OAuth authentication flow fully verified and working
- **COMPLETED**: User can successfully login with Google and see confirmation page
- **COMPLETED**: Logout functionality working correctly
- **COMPLETED**: All console errors resolved and suppressed
- **MILESTONE 1.1 ACHIEVED**: Google OAuth Login implementation complete

## Lessons
- Always check project structure before assuming existing setup
- Clarify requirements before beginning implementation
- Document setup steps for external services (Google Cloud, Supabase)
- Project is already initialized with Next.js 14 App Router and Tailwind CSS
- Working within existing structure, no new project initialization needed
- Use @supabase/ssr instead of deprecated @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
- Next.js 15 requires await for cookies() function
- React 19 is now stable and recommended for Next.js 15
- User state management is crucial for good authentication UX
- Always provide visual feedback for authentication status
