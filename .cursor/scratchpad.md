# Floro Project - Google OAuth Implementation

## Background and Motivation
Implement Google OAuth Login for the Floro application using Supabase Auth, allowing users to sign up and log in using their Google accounts.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Working within existing Next.js 14 App Router structure
- Google OAuth configuration in both Google Cloud and Supabase
- Environment variable management
- Authentication flow implementation
- Preserving existing Tailwind CSS styling and App Router architecture

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Manual Setup Instructions ✅
- [x] Provide Google Cloud setup instructions
- [x] Provide Supabase project setup instructions
- [x] Document required environment variables

### Phase 2: Dependencies Installation ✅
- [x] Install required Supabase libraries (@supabase/ssr, @supabase/supabase-js)
- [x] Install Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

### Phase 3: Project Structure Setup ✅
- [x] Create Next.js configuration files (next.config.js, tsconfig.json)
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS configuration
- [x] Create basic project structure with App Router

### Phase 4: Supabase Client Setup ✅
- [x] Create Supabase client configuration
- [x] Set up authentication helpers

### Phase 5: Authentication Implementation ✅
- [x] Update existing src/app/page.tsx with Google login button
- [x] Implement OAuth callback route
- [x] Wire up authentication flow

### Phase 6: Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test local development setup
- [ ] Verify Google OAuth flow
- [ ] Document manual setup requirements

## Project Status Board
- [x] Manual setup instructions provided
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Environment configuration documented
- [x] Supabase client created
- [x] Authentication implemented
- [ ] Testing completed

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Status**: Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

**Next Action**: User needs to complete manual setup (Google Cloud + Supabase) and provide credentials, then we can test the OAuth flow.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**Current Request**: Implementation is complete. User needs to:
1. Follow the setup instructions in README.md
2. Create Google Cloud OAuth credentials
3. Create Supabase project and configure Google provider
4. Provide environment variables
5. Test the application

## Lessons
- Always check project structure before assuming existing setup
- Clarify requirements before beginning implementation
- Document setup steps for external services (Google Cloud, Supabase)
- Project is already initialized with Next.js 14 App Router and Tailwind CSS
- Working within existing structure, no new project initialization needed
- Use @supabase/ssr instead of deprecated @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
