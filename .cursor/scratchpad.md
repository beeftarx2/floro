## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Status**: Enhanced Security Edge Function Deployed - Ready for UI Enhancement! 🎉

**Next Action**: Ready to implement Milestone 1: Create School Selection UI for improved user experience and clearer university selection.

## 🎯 **MILESTONE 1: School Selection UI - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Objective**
Create a two-step front-end experience where users first select their university from a list and are then taken to a dedicated login page for that school.

### **Files That Will Be Modified/Created**
- **MODIFIED**: `src/app/page.tsx` - Replace current landing page with school selection
- **NEW**: `src/app/login/[school]/page.tsx` - Dynamic route for school-specific login pages

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Replace Landing Page** - Convert current page to school selection interface
2. **Create Dynamic Routes** - Set up school-specific login pages
3. **Maintain Security** - Keep all existing security measures intact
4. **Preserve Functionality** - Ensure OAuth and security systems remain working

### **Risk Assessment**
- **MEDIUM RISK** - Modifying the main landing page
- **EXISTING FEATURES PRESERVED** - All authentication and security systems remain intact
- **UI ENHANCEMENT** - Improves user experience without breaking core functionality

### **Verification Points**
- School selection page displays correctly with all 10 universities
- Dynamic routing works for each school
- Google OAuth functionality preserved
- Security measures remain active

## 🎯 **MILESTONE 3: Deploy and Activate Edge Function - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Objective**
Deploy the 'email-allowlist' Edge Function to Supabase and configure it as an Authentication Hook to run automatically on every new user sign-up.

### **Files That Will Be Touched**
- **NO EXISTING FILES MODIFIED** - This milestone only deploys and configures
- **Edge Function**: Will be deployed to Supabase cloud
- **Dashboard Configuration**: Authentication Hooks setup

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Deploy Edge Function** - Use CLI to deploy to Supabase servers
2. **Configure Auth Hook** - Set up function as automatic trigger on user creation
3. **Test Functionality** - Verify allowlist works with real user registrations

### **Risk Assessment**
- **LOW RISK** - This milestone only deploys existing code and configures hooks
- **NO CODE CHANGES** - All existing authentication functionality remains untouched
- **PRODUCTION ACTIVATION** - Function becomes live and active

### **Verification Points**
- Function deploys successfully without errors
- Auth Hook configured in Supabase dashboard
- Function triggers on new user creation
- Allowlist correctly filters users by domain

## 🎯 **MILESTONE 2: Email Allowlist Edge Function - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Objective**
Create a Supabase Edge Function that verifies new user email domains against an approved list and deletes users with unauthorized domains.

### **Files That Will Be Created/Modified**
- **NEW**: `supabase/functions/email-allowlist/index.ts` - Main Edge Function logic
- **NEW**: `supabase/functions/email-allowlist/` directory structure

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Create Edge Function** - Use Supabase CLI to generate boilerplate
2. **Implement Logic** - Replace boilerplate with email domain verification code
3. **Configure Allowlist** - Set up approved UC school domains
4. **Test Function** - Verify local serving works without errors

### **Risk Assessment**
- **LOW RISK** - This milestone creates new files without modifying existing code
- **NO EXISTING CODE CHANGES** - All authentication functionality remains untouched
- **NEW FUNCTIONALITY** - Adds security layer for user registration

### **Verification Points**
- Function directory created successfully
- Code implements domain checking logic
- Function serves locally without errors
- UC school domains properly configured

## 🎯 **MILESTONE 1: Supabase CLI & Local Setup - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Objective**
Install Supabase CLI globally and link local `floro` project to remote Supabase project for Edge Function development.

### **Files That Will Be Touched**
- **No existing files will be modified** - This is a CLI setup milestone
- **New files may be created** by Supabase CLI during initialization

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Install Supabase CLI globally** (`npm install -g supabase`)
2. **Authenticate with Supabase** (`supabase login`)
3. **Link local project to remote** (`supabase link --project-ref PROJECT_ID`)
4. **Verify successful setup** with version checks and link confirmation

### **Risk Assessment**
- **LOW RISK** - This milestone only involves CLI tools and project linking
- **NO CODE CHANGES** - Existing authentication functionality remains untouched
- **ENVIRONMENT SETUP** - Prepares infrastructure for future development

### **Verification Points**
- CLI installation successful (`supabase --version`)
- Authentication successful (browser authorization)
- Project linking successful (`Finished supabase link` message)

## Lessons
- Always check project structure before assuming existing setup
- Clarify requirements before beginning implementation
- Document setup steps for external services (Google Cloud, Supabase)
- Project is already initialized with Next.js 14 App Router and Tailwind CSS
- Working within existing structure, no new project initialization needed
- Use @supabase/ssr instead of deprecated @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
- Next.js 15 requires await for cookies() function
- React 19 is now stable and recommended for Next.js 15
- User state management is crucial for good authentication UX
- Always provide visual feedback for authentication status
